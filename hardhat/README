SevenDots Smart Contracts
=========================

## Installation

This directory is based on [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#installation).
Please make sure to install it properly.

Then you have to run:

```npm install```

### Run a local development environment

To run a local development you first have run a local node of hardhat:

```npx hardhat node```

And then, in another window, deploy the fixtures:

```npx hardhat run scripts/deployDev.ts --network local```

Nice! Now you can go to vitesse and start the frontend.

It is still recommended that you:

## Prepare Metamask

### Add Hardhat network to Metamask

This project uses chainId 1337 for the local network! 
This is different to HardHad's default 31337 chainId.

You have to add this network to Metamask:

Name: `Localhost 8545`

RPC: `http://localhost:8545`

ChainId: `1337`

### Add Testuser to Metamask

Add Alice to Metamask, her private key is:

```0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d```

Alice has some NFTs, and all allowances set. 

Have fun!
