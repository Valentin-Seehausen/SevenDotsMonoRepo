        Seven Dots Whitepaper
      </h3>
      <p class="my-4">
        Where does DeFi end and NFT begin? At Seven Dots the community creates unique NFTs by combining dots in seven colors on seven fields. For this creative work, the community will get 80% of all profits and early users will benefit from increased staking rewards. Seven Dots is very inclusive and offers a great opportunity for people that want to join a NFT/DeFi project in the early days (start of the project was January 27th 2022).
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        If you are interested, here is a 5 minute introduction:
      </p>

      <p class="my-4 border-black border-2 p-2">
        Before we start: You need Matic (the native token of Polygon) and wETH (wrapped ETH on Polygon) to interact with Seven Dots. Seven Dots uses a lot of gas, and Polygon offers cheap and efficient transaction costs. <a href="https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge/" target="_blank" class="underline">Bridge wETH here</a>.

        So here we go, this is a token with 1 dot on field 1 and of color 1. We write this as: <strong>dna: c1f1</strong>.

      <p class="my-4">
        And here is the trick: These dots are the attributes of an NFT. They can be combined to create more complex and more beautiful (or at least colorful) NFTs. We combine attributes, by <strong>stacking token</strong> together.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        Here is a token with 2 dots, and <strong>dna: f1c21</strong> (Field 1 has Color 2 and Color 1, from top to bottom):

      <p class="my-4">
        Funny right? This works in both direction and takes 2 hours waiting time (gamification!).
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        There are 7 fields and 7 colors. And to be precise each field is a column of 7 field, so there are 49 fields in total.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        The <strong>rarity</strong> of the attributes is completely deterministic. A continuous mint id determines which dot is minted on wich field. First mint will be f1c1 (rare), next two mints will be f1c2, next three mints will be f1c3, four times f1c4, five times f1c6, six times f1c6, and finally seven times f1c7 (not rare). This will be 28 mints for field 1, next comes field 2. For 7 fields, this makes 196 mints before the cycle repeads itself. To make it more interesting, the first and rarest color on field 2 is color 2. And the most common color on field 2 is color 1. The rarity is shifted for each field.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        To illustrate is easy, here is a token with the most rare colors of each field (<strong>dna: f1c1f2c2f3c3f4c4f5c5f6c6f7c7</strong>). Each single field-color combination has a rarity of 3.57% (1 / 28), the whole token has a rarity of 0.51% (1 / 196):

      <p class="my-4">
        Background: The production of NFTs by the community was inspired observing frictions at the mint process of other NFT projects. Often bots and frontrunners can analyze the code, calculate the rare attributes of NFTs and mint only these by skyrocketing the gas costs. Seven Dots gives the creation of NFTs in the hand of the community in a transparent way.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-lg bold mt-8">
        Sale Process
      </h3>

      <p class="my-4">
        Another observation of NFT projects is that the sale process is tricky. Mostly insiders and bots can enjoy minting and early access. Mints happen in a few hours and marketing has to be strong for it to be successful. On the other hand, the mint auction is then overrun and crowded. Specific timezones have an easier access than others. The sale process of Seven Dot optimizes the incentives for early users, while still being very lucrative to join later. So people can drop in the project at any time and the community can grow organically. A fair valuation of the project by the auction prices can happen at all times.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        The process in detail: There will be <strong>77,777 dots minted</strong>. Every dot will be sold in an auction, so <strong>77,777 auctions</strong> will be created. A maximum of <strong>196 parallel auctions</strong> can be open at the same time (start price 0.001 wETH). Each auction is open for 1 day. When the sale runs on full capacity, the runway is slightly longer than a year. Most probably it will take some more time.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        With this process the community of Seven Dots can maximize the income, as this process will make sure the real market value of Seven Dots will be collected through the auctions of the NFTs.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        Most importantly, this is only the sale process of the single dots. The final <strong>unique NFTs will be sold by the single user</strong> that created them. NFTs can be sold on OpenSea. 90% will go to the single user, 1.5% to artist, 6% to the treasury and 2.5% to OpenSea (standard for a 10% royalty). Non-unique NFTs can also be sold.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-lg bold mt-8">
        Tokenomics
      </h3>
      <p class="my-4">
        All profits of the auctions will go to the artist (20%) and the community (80%). The amount gets transfered to the <strong>treasury</strong>. Community members own a portion of the treasury dependend on the amount of <strong>7DOTS ERC20 token</strong> they own. 7DOTS can be earned by: creating an auction (0.1 7DOTS) and by stacking two token (7 7DOTS).
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        7DOTS token can be staked. Each stack will trigger the staking reward and inrease the staking faktor. The staking faktor starts at 1.0 and after 77,777 stacks it will reach 7.0. The staking factor is inversed at staking. This means, that early users will be able to get seven times more of the treasury for stacking tokens. Most probably they will also be able to buy dots for very low prices. When all 7DOTS tokens get staked, 25% of all (compounded) 7DOTS will be emitted after 10,000 stacks, which is 12.5% of the time.
      </p>

      <img src="/images/tokenomics.png">

      <p class="my-4">
        So early users have a double incentive: Prices for NFTs will be low and the share of the treasury as a reward for creating art is proportionally higher. This is deliberately set, as the project is meant to be community driven with active users taking up roles of community organization and marketing (and receiving a huge share of the treasury as a reward).
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        <strong>An example</strong>: If prices stay low for the first 10,000 stacks (25% of total emissions, earliest after 52 days, probably it will take longer), this could mean an inflow of 10 wETH, of which 8 wETH are in the treasury. Now, the community can start to market the project, sell first unique NFTs on OpenSea and by this increase interest, demand and prices. The possible future inflow of the remaining 67,777 auctions will increase the treasury by at least seven fold, which will offer a 7x return after one year. When prices increase over the minimum bid, the return increases even more. Plus users produce the actual artwork and can sell the most interesting NFTs, as they have a broader choice of unique NFTs.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        Users can withdraw their share of the treasury at all times, but it is a one-way ticket. 7DOTS token can only by earned by stacking token (and thus creating the artwork of Seven Dots).
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        When a Seven Dot NFT gets sold on OpenSea, 80% of the royalty will be transfered to the treasury, so users have to make a decision of when they want to pull out.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        You see, a coopration with a liquitity provider that accepts staked 7DOTS (s7DOTS) would be beneficial to offer capital efficiency and the long-term treasury increase of Seven Dots.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-lg bold mt-8">
        Uniqueness
      </h3>
      <p class="my-4">
        There are only seven colors and seven fields, so what will make the artwork interesting? When a NFT comprises 49 dots, it reaches uniqueness. It will not be possible to stack tokens to reach this unique combination anymore. A total of 77,777 dots will make an absolute maximum of 1,587 unique NFTs. As this would mean all dots are stacked without losses, it is more likely that the actual number of unique NFTs will be lower.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-lg bold mt-8">
        Technology
      </h3>
      <p class="my-4">
        All data is created on chain. The dna is minimized into a byte32 and saved in storage for every token. The tokenURI gets calculated from this seed in memory. This minimizes storage and maximizes information. The SVG is created on-chain and returned as a base64 encoded image.
      </p>
