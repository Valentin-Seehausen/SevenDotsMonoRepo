Terms of Service
================

This is a DeFi / NFT protocol in beta. By using this website you comply and agree to following terms:

* Everything you do, buy, spend, exchange or otherwisely do is based on your own voluntary decision.
* Several risks apply (smart contract risks, protocol risks, tokenomic risks, etc). You will do you own research and will only invest an amount that does not hurt you, when you face a total loss.
* Again: The biggest risk is a full loss of all your invested cryptos.
* This is a beta project and can have hackable programming mistakes.
* The idea, the artwork and the code is owned by OCTS. You may not use it for commercial usage.
* All usual Terms of Service do also apply.

With this being said: I did my best to build a safe and enjoyable DeFi / NFT protocol. I am happy that you are one of the test users. 

Have fun and keep in mind that all krypto has a real money value.
